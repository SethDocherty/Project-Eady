## Project Eady

Eady the climate snake is an interactive reptile who illustrates the temperature of her every-changing environment. Each day she grows a new band with a color palate that depicts the temperatures of her local climate. The concept is influenced by the temperature [snake](https://www.planetjune.com/blog/announcing-the-2023-temperature-snake-cal/) [blankets](https://hearthookhome.com/temperature-blanket-ideas-tutorial/) crochet projects.
